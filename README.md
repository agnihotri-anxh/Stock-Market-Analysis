- Interactive visualizations using Plotly
- 10 different prediction models:
  1. Prophet
  2. LSTM (Deep Learning)
  3. ARIMA
  4. SARIMA
  5. XGBoost
  6. LightGBM
  7. CatBoost
  8. Random Forest
  9. SVR (Support Vector Regression)
  10. Ensemble (Coming soon)

## Setup

1. Create a virtual environment (recommended):
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

2. Install dependencies:
